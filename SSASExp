sTell me about your SSAS experience

During my time working on a project for
Cardinal Financials, one of the project 
requirement was to create a Data 
Warehouse for one of the OLTP databases 
which was very large and had the usual 
Mortgage Loan related transactional 
data like the borrower, loan, 
property, and the financial information.

This of course required the
creation of Fact and Dimension tables 
that were suitable for an SSAS Cube 
which would be a source for the 
SSRS Reporting that they required.

But before getting to the phase 
of creating the Cube, I went through the
necessary process of automating the 
ETL processes using SSIS and cleaned,
transformed, and loaded the data into an
ODS database where short-term reports
could be created while I continued to 
develop the more efficient Data 
Warehouse and SSAS Cube.

I then went ahead and developed a 
multidimentional Star Schema which 
consisted of a Fact table and 3 
dimensions. And as it is with all large
databases, I had to be particularly
precise about ensuring the Foreign Keys 
were pointing to the correct Primary 
keys of the dimension tables and ensured
that the the correct measures were set
for aggregation so they could provide 
meaningful value to the business. 

In order to keep the history of specific 
information like changed Last Name and 
Loan Amount, I used a SQL MERGE to run
a SSIS Slowly Changing Dimension to 
maintain an updated database.

The Data Warehouse was now ready for
the Cube.
