Tell me about your SSAS experience

During my time working on a project for
Cardinal Financials, one of the project 
requirements was to create a Data 
Warehouse for one of the OLTP databases 
which was very large and had the usual 
Mortgage Loan related transactional 
data like the borrower, loan, 
property, and the financial information.

This of course required the
creation of Fact and Dimension tables 
that were suitable for an SSAS Cube 
which would be a source for the 
SSRS Reporting that they required.

But before getting to this final phase 
of creating the Cube, I went through the
necessary process of automating the 
ETL process using SSIS, and then 
eventually loaded the data from the 
ODS database
