What is a View?

A view is a virtual table whose contents are defined by a query.
 Like a table, a view consists of a set of named columns and 
 rows of data. Unless indexed, a view does not exist as a stored 
 set of data values in a database. The rows and columns of data 
 come from tables referenced in the query defining the view and 
 are produced dynamically when the view is referenced.

A view acts as a filter on the underlying tables referenced in the view.
 The query that defines the view can be from one or more tables or 
 from other views in the current or other databases.
 Distributed queries can also be used to define views that use data 
 from multiple heterogeneous sources.
 
 This is useful, for example, if you want to combine similarly 
 structured data from different servers, each of which stores 
 data for a different region of your organization.


Views are generally used to focus, simplify, and customize the 
perception each user has of the database.

 Views can be used as security mechanisms by letting users access
 data through the view, without granting the users permissions to
 directly access the underlying base tables of the view.
 
 Views can be used to provide a backward compatible interface to 
 emulate a table that used to exist but whose schema has changed.
 Views can also be used when you copy data to and from SQL Server 
 to improve performance and to partition data.
