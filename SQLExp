Tell me about your SQL experience

Working as a Business Intelligence 
Developer for Cardinal Financial, 
I have gained good experience using 
SQL Server 2014 & 2017, Visual 
Studio 2013 & 2017. 

Using T-SQL, I have created Tables, 
Views, User Defined Functions, 
Common Table Expressions, 
Temporary tables, Indexes, 
Stored Procedures, Triggers 
and so forth.

I have gained in-depth 
understanding of database
concepts like the creation of
database objects, the importance
of database backup, performance 
tuning, and query optimization.

I've used various DML operations
to create and modify database 
objects such as Tables, Views,
Triggers, User Defined Functions, 
simple and complex Stored 
Procedures, Temperory Data
structures like Common Table 
Expressions (CTE), Temperory Tables
and Variables.

Using DML operations I have 
performed various Inserts,
Updates, Deletes, and Select
operations to modify and retrieve
the data according to the business
requirements.

I have also used Transactional 
commands like COMMIT, ROLLBACK,
and SET Transactions to specify
the characteristics of the 
transaction and to commit or 
rollback a transaction based 
on the conditions or in the 
case of errors. 

I have experience with creating
Indexes and Constraints while
defining the table structures, 
in order to establish data 
integrity, and for optimal 
query performance.

I am also well versed with 
using execution plans, 
SQL Profiler, and the 
Tuning Advisor, to tune and
optimize queries.

I've had opportunities to use
a wide range of functions like
the DATE, CAST, CONVERT 
functions, While Loops, CTEs, 
and UDFs to apply the business
logic. 

I am also knowlegeable in 
building OLTP and OLAP data 
Models using the Star and
Snowflakes Schemas.

In a recent project I worked on
with Cardinal Financials, 
part of the requirements 
was to create a Data Warehouse 
for reporting purposes.

I used the existing SQL database 
to create the Denormalized 
datasets, pulled the data from 
numerous tables using complex
JOIN queries, then manipulated
it using several System 
Functions like:

CASE WHEN statements to apply 
conditions, 

CAST functions to change the 
Data Types, 

CharIndex and Substring 
functions, and some 
arithmatical and logical 
operators involving complex
subqueries.

I stored the Denormalized 
datasets into Denormalized
Temperory Tables and used
those to load the Fact and
Dimensions by creating a
Stored Procedure for 
performing incremental
loading of the database 
with Slowly Changing 
Dimension, using the 
MERGE Statement.

I make sure I follow Best
Practices when creating 
queries and implementing
database concepts. 

I also include detailed 
comments with the code, 
providing the business 
logic for co-worker or 
future review.

I strive to keep up to 
date with current tools
and techniques in the 
market so as to benefit
the company.
