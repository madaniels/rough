Tell me about your SQL experience

As a BI Developer, I created Stored 
Procedures, Triggers, 
User-Defined Functions, Views for 
handling business logic and the 
functionality of various modules.

I reviewed and enhanced existing 
UDF and Sprocs. I etablished 
referential integrity, data 
consistency, indexing and 
data cleanup procedures to 
maintain high quality data 
for reporting purposes.
