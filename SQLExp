Tell me about your SQL experience

Working as a Business Intelligence 
Developer for Cardinal Financial, 
I have gained good experience using 
SQL Server 2014 & 2017, 
Visual Studio 2013 & 2017. 

Using T-SQL, I have created Tables, 
Views, User Defined Functions, 
Common Table Expressions, 
Temporary tables, Indexes, 
Stored Procedures, Triggers 
and so forth.

I have acquired in-depth 
understanding of various database
concepts like the creation of
database objects, the importance
of database backup, performance 
tuning, query optimization.

I've used various DML operations
to create and modify database 
objects such as Tables, Views,
Triggers, UDF, simple and complex
Stored Procedures, Temperory data
structures like Common Table 
Expressions (CTE), Temperory Tables
and Variables.

Using DML operations I have 
performed various Inserts,
Updates, Deletes, and Select
operations to modify and retrieve
the data according to the business
requirements.
