How do you handle security in SSRS? 
Explain with use-case examples.

Handling SSRS report security is done
at the Data Source level which is usually
managed by the DBA and the Report
Server level which is predined at two
levels, System Admin and System User.

The System Administrator Role by default
has permissions over the whole Report
Server.

Setting the security can be done at the
Group or Individual level.

As a BI Developer for Cardinal Financials
I developed numerous Reports and 
Subscriptions, and was tasked to grant
the specific access and to ensure their
security at the Report Server level.

The Report Manager allowed me to grant
specific access to Users or Groups.

From the Report Manager home page and 
Site Settings I assign users or groups
to a System Role and sometimes I create 
or modify a System Role Definition.

The System Admin Role has the ability 
to View and modify system role 
assignments, system role definitions, 
system properties, and shared schedules.

The System User Role has the ability to
View system properties, shared schedules, 
and can use the Report Builder or other 
client applications that execute 
report definitions.

I have implimented security at the Report
Level where I can select which tasks 
a specific Role can perform on a specific
report. I have implemented requirements
where the user Role is limited to just
viewing and subscribing to a report, as 
well as Roles where I enabled Content 
Management, Plublishing, and so forth.

I implimented User access Credential 
requirements which means that the user
has to have specific credentials for 
access to specific data sources.
