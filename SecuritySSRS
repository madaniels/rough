How do you handle security in SSRS? 
Explain with use-case examples.

As a BI Developer for Cardinal Financials
I developed numerous Reports and 
Subscriptions, and was tasked to grant
the specific access and to ensure their
security at the Report Server level.

The Report Manager allows me to grant
specific access to Users or Groups.

From the Report Manager home page and 
Site Settings I assign users or groups
to a system role sometimes create or 
modify a system role definition.

The System Admin Role has the ability 
to View and modify system role 
assignments, system role definitions, 
system properties, and shared schedules.

The System User Role has the ability to
View system properties, shared schedules, 
and can use the Report Builder or other 
client applications that execute 
report definitions.
