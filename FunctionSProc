What are the differences between a Function and a Stored Procedure?

Function must return a value but in Stored Procedure it is optional.
 Even a procedure can return zero or n values.
 Functions can have only input parameters for it whereas Procedures 
 can have input or output parameters . Functions can be called from
 Procedure whereas Procedures cannot be called from a Function.


Procedure allows SELECT as well as DML(INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) 
statement in it whereas Function allows only SELECT statement in it.


Procedures can not be utilized in a SELECT statement whereas 
Function can be embedded in a SELECT statement.


Stored Procedures cannot be used in the SQL statements anywhere 
in the WHERE/HAVING/SELECT section whereas Function can be.


Functions that return tables can be treated as another rowset.
 This can be used in JOINs with other tables.


Inline Function can be though of as views that take parameters 
and can be used in JOINs and other Rowset operations.


Exception can be handled by try-catch block in a Procedure 
whereas try-catch block cannot be used in a Function.


We can use Transactions in Procedure whereas we can't use 
Transactions in Function.
