How do you load XML files?

To explain How do you load XML files, I would like to tell you about a recent project I worked on where the requirement was to load multiple XML files to SQL Server using SSIS.

I did this for both denormalized XML files and normalized files that had complex structures. 

My preference was to go with the denormalized XML file structure because denormalizing the file makes the process a lot faster because the normalized XML file required additional steps.

But I'll explain the normalized version first and if there's time I'll explain the denormalized version.

So, first I:
Created a new SSIS package. 
Placed a new Data Flow Task in the Control Flow
Opened the Data Flow Task.
Placed an XML Source tool, a Data Conversion tool, and OLE DB Destination tool in the Data Flow.

I then:
Opened the XML Source Editor 
Chose "XML file location" as the Data Access Mode, 
Browsed to the location of the XML file. 

I chose to Generate a new XSD for the XML schema definition because I didn't have one.

Still in the XML Source Editor and from the Columns tab and "Output Name" drop down list, I chose each Node, Borrower, Financial_Detail, Property_Detail, or Loan_Detail respectively, and selected the columns that had to be inserted into each staging table.

Next is the Data conversion Transformation.
Here I modified the data types of the output columns according to the data types of the OLE DB Destination. 

Finally on to configure the OLE DB Destination.
While in the OLE DB Destination Editor, I created a new Connection Manager.
Selected the Name of the destination Table from Drop down list.

And, in the Mappingâ€™s tab, mapped each Output column with the appropriate Input column and made sure I chose the correct Alias according to the Data Conversion I had previously done.


I gave the package a name according to proper naming convention and
Executed the package. This loaded the data into the respective SQL Server Staging tables.
