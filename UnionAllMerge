What is the differences between UNION All and Merge?

The Merge Transformation can only accept two datasets but the Union All Transformation can accept more than two datasets for the input.
 

Merge requires both input datasets to be sorted but Union All does not require the datasets to be sorted.


In a recent project one of the requirements was to use a single SSIS package to load data from 3 different sources,
 OLEDB,
 Excel,
 and XML.


I combined all 3 sources with the UNION All tool because the Merge Transformation could take only 2 sources.
 

So,
 I first did a data Conversion for each,
 seperately,
 and in the Excel Data Conversion Transformation Editor I selected the relevent columns and converted the Excel Unicode data types to ones compatible with SQL Server.
 
In this case the data Conversions were mainly to Strings,
 4-byte signed Integers,
 and the database timestamp.
 

I also did a Data Conversion on the Unicode data format coming from the XML source.


I then used the UNION All tool to combine the OLTP,
 Excel and XML data.
 This worked well.


Following the combining of all 3 sources I could load them into an OLEDB Destination table.


In a similar project,
 with 2 sources,
 the input data was not sorted and the output data needed sorting for a report.
 I could not take advantage of the efficiency of using a Union All Transformation so I had to go with a Merge Transformation,
 which required Sorting before the Merge.
 Fortunately the volume of data was small.


Now,
 doing the Sorting in SSIS on large volumes of data is inadvisable but you can Sort the data prior to SSIS Transformations and there'll be no need for a Sort .
 You simple have to Sort the data and let SSIS know via the OLEDB Advanced Editor and set the IsSorted to true and set the SortKeyPosition position.


So choose Union All over Merge when: the transformation inputs are not sorted,
 the combined output does not need to be sorted,
 the transformation has more than two inputs.
