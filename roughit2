One of the more recent projects I've worked 
on was for a Mortgage Lending Company that 
used the standard 1003 Application Form for 
all applicants.

The essential requirements were:
Data validations according their online 
website required fields.

The Data warehouse had to meet the future 
growth of the group and reports had to 
provide business intelligence on an daily, 
weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly basis.

The company wanted frequent project 
deliverables and required the Agile 
methodology to be used.
 
I divided the project into 2 Releases, 
6 Sprints and 10 User stories. 

Release 1 entailed the ETL process using SSIS
and Release 2 was the Report creation process
using SSRS.

Story 1 dealt mainly with the gathering and 
documenting of all the Application data from 
3 different sources, the customer's OLTP 
Database and also from XML and Excel files.

Story 2 and 3 dealt with the Extracted, 
Transformation, and Loading of the data into 
4 Staging tables.

In order to speed up and shorten the SSRS 
loading process of the XML data, I 
denormalized the XML structure.

For the OLTP database data source I used a 
JOIN to load all the OLTP data into 1 OLEDB 
Source. I also used an Excel Source for the 
Excel files and a C# script to ensure the 
data was captured accurately into the Excel 
spreadsheet.

I sent all the data through a Data Conversion
Transformation because of the Unicode data 
types from the Excel and XML sources.

With help of a Sort and Merge Transformation 
I combined all the data and used a Multicast 
to split them into their respective Staging 
tables.

Story 4 dealt with Data Validation and 
Error Handling. Here I seperated the 
Good and Bad data using the Conditional Split
Transformation, and returned the Bad data to 
the customer for correction. The Bad Data had
unwanted NULL rows, incorrect number of 
digits for phone numbers, Social Security 
Numbers, and Zip codes.

In order to send the Bad Data back for 
correction and validation via email, I used 
an Execute SQL Task and SendMail Stored 
Procedure, using the Database Mail in 
SQL Server.

Story 5: The Good data then went through a 
Data Conversion and finally loaded to an 
ODS (Operational Data Store) database in 
SQL Server, into a single table.

Story 6: involved creating an OLAP 
(Online Analytical Processing) data warehouse
to maintain the history, for data analysis, 
long term storage, and reporting.

I developed a Multidimentional Star Schema 
which consisted of a Fact table and 
3 Dimensions. In order to keep the history of
specific information like changed Last Name 
and Loan Amount, I used the SSIS Slowly 
Changing Dimension Transformation forTypes 1 
and 2. So when a Last Name changes, perhaps 
due to marriage, then the SCD would INSERT 
the new row with the new Last Name and set 
the value in the Status column to Current 
while setting the Status of the original row 
to Expired. For the Loan Amount, the SCD new 
row had a NULL value in the date column and 
a date and time in the EndDate column. I also
developed a simple SQL MERGE Stored Procedure
to take care of any Type 3 requirements.
