SSIS - How do you do performance tuning

Performance Tuning is a way of optimizing 
an SSIS package to run in such a way as 
to use the least amount of resources and 
to shorten the execution time.

The first task to ensure performance
optimization is to determine where in the
ETL process the delays are occurring, the
source, transformation, or the destination
component.

One way of seeing what is occurring during
execution is to study the Progress tab 
which contains all the information from
start to the end of package execution,
having all the warnings and errors.

If performance is being stifled at the 
source component, and tables are being
used, then I usually check to see 
whether all the columns being extracted
are really needed, if not, I exclude them
from the Stored Procedure being used to
during this phase, by using a WHERE clause
to filter them out.

Next, I make sure that appropriate tasks 
are run parallel to each other using the 
Sequence Container. This provides a 
substatantial boost to performance versas
running every task sequentially.

When I find delays in the Transformation 
component, I review the Transformations 
being used and make sure there are no
unecessary Transformations that are
blocking, like the Aggregate and the 
Sort Transformations.

And similarly with regard to 
semi-blocking Transformations like the
JOIN Transformation.
