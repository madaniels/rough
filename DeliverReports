HOW HAVE YOU DELIVERED REPORTS TO THE END USERS



After completing my reports, I deploy them to the Report Server, 
make sure everything is working well and running as expected.

I then use the Report Manger to setup either a Standard or 
data driven Subscription.

The Standard Subscription is a static Report that is sent to 
all of the Subscribers of the report and contains information 
that does not change. So it does not have parameters and access 
to the report is via a secure access method.

A data driven report is one that is dynamic and is created based 
on parameters changed via a dropdown list or similar.

I've sent out standard email subscriptions in the form of pdf 
or excel attachments.

I've sent out emails that contain hyperlinks to the relevant 
report and links to a secure fileshare folders.
