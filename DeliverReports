HOW HAVE YOU DELIVERED REPORTS TO THE END USERS

As a BI developer at Cardinal Financial, I had the 
opportunity to build and deliver reports to end users.

The Report Server provides 2 methods of setting up report 
subscriptions for report delivery, one is the standard or 
genereal method and the other is the data driven method. 

I have used both methods. So, after completing my reports, 
I deploy them to the Report Server and make sure everything 
is working well and running as expected before setting up
any subscriptions. I make sure I have the correct report
users matched to the correct report.

I then use the Report Manager to setup either a Standard or 
data driven Subscription.

The Standard Subscription is a static Report that is sent to 
all of the Subscribers of the report and contains information 
that does not change. So it does not have parameters and access 
to these reports is relatively easy and without any retrictions.

A data driven report is one that is dynamic and is created based 
on parameters and delivered based on user access permissions. So,
a user is given access to specific reports based on their access
level.

The parameters also include report specific parameters and 
the application format.

I've sent out standard email subscriptions in the form of pdf 
or excel attachments.

I've sent out emails that contain hyperlinks to the relevant 
report and links to a secure fileshare folders.
