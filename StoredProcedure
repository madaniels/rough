What is Stored Procedure?

A stored procedure in SQL Server is a group of one or more 
T-SQL statements. They Accept input parameters and return 
multiple values in the form of output parameters to the 
calling program.

It is good practice to use Stored Procedures for data 
modification and data retrieval. Stored procedures 
many provide benefits where Client applications don't 
need to work with the data directly, they call the 
SP instead. 

The underlying database schema can be modified without 
having an impact on an application as long as the SP 
is changed appropriately.

In terms of Security, Client applications can access 
data through SP and other programmatic objects only. 
Users do not have direct permissions on those 
underlying objects

For example, even if an end user uses their own 
SQL Server Management Studio instead of the client 
application that the user should use, the user still 
cannot modify the data in an uncontrolled way directly 
in the tables. 

With regard to Performance, SPs can reduce network 
traffic, because you can execute many statements 
inside the SP within a single call to a SP. 

This can significantly reduce network 
traffic between the server and client because only the 
call to execute the procedure is sent across the network.
Without the code encapsulation provided by a procedure,
every individual line of code would have to cross the 
network.

SQL Server optimizes and compiles the code an 
application sends, by storing the optimized and 
compiled code in memory. 

The compiled execution plans for SP are held longer 
in memory than the execution plans for ad hoc queries 
so they get reused more frequently. 

Usage: 
Stored procedures accept input and can return output 
parameters, so they can be easily coded to serve multiple users.
