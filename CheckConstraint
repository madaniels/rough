What is Check Constraint?

CHECK constraints enforce domain integrity by limiting the values that are accepted by one or more columns. You can create a CHECK constraint with any logical (Boolean) expression that returns TRUE or FALSE based on the logical operators. For example, the range of values for a salary column can be limited by creating a CHECK constraint that allows for only data that ranges from $15,000 through $100,000. This prevents salaries from being entered beyond the regular salary range. The logical expression would be the following: salary >= 15000 AND salary <= 100000.

You can apply multiple CHECK constraints to a single column. You can also apply a single CHECK constraint to multiple columns by creating it at the table level. 

In a previous project I worked on, the requirement was for a multiple-column CHECK constraint to be used to confirm that any row with a country_region column value of USA also had a two-character value in the state column. This allowed for multiple conditions to be checked in one location.

CHECK constraints are similar to FOREIGN KEY constraints in that they control the values that are put in a column. The difference is in how they determine which values are valid: FOREIGN KEY constraints obtain the list of valid values from another table, while CHECK constraints determine the valid values from a logical expression.
